Test::HTML::W3C is a testing module, which uses Test::Builder::Module and is in
the spirit Test::More. It simply wraps WebService::Validator::HTML::W3C and
provides some convenient functions to detect HTML/XHTML validation problems
using services provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Please note
that, as with WebService::Validator::HTML::W3C, this particular module has
absolutely no connection with the good folks at W3C. Please DO NOT report any
problems with it to them. In addition, please do not abuse the W3C's validator
service. If you need to do lots of validation testing, try downloading and
installing the validator software and modifying the validator uri this module
uses per the documentation.
